## **Overview**
This app contains a single view controller with the following views and functionalities:

_Views_
- A red square in the top left corner
- A white rectangle in the middle of the screen
- A purple rectangle in the white rectangle
- A blue square in the bottom right corner
- A timer in the bottom left corner

_Functionalities_

- On tap on the white or purple rectangle:
    - the white and purple rectangles resize
    - the timer restarts

- In landscape mode, the purple rectangle disappears.

- The app has been localized to French and uses DateComponentsFormatter as much as possible to garantee the correct locale presentation of the timer's digits.

- The app supports the following accessibility settings:
    - Voice Over
    - Dynamic Type
    - Bold Text

_Testing_

The app comes with a set of tests and UI tests to validate its behavior.
